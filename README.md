# QuickChat-App
I tried making a Flutter-based chat application, designed to provide a seamless, real-time communication experience with the robustness and security of Google Firebase. The QuickChat app allows users to create accounts and log in using email and password.

Key Features of this app that I made are:
1. User Authentication:
Email and Password: Users can register and log in using their email and password. Firebase Authentication ensures data security and manages user credentials.

2. Real-Time Chat:
Instant Messaging: Users can send and receive messages in real-time, ensuring efficient and prompt communication.
Recent Chats: The app lists recent chat conversations, allowing users to quickly resume their discussions.

3. User Management:
Logout Functionality: Secure logout options ensure user sessions are terminated safely.

4. Cloud Storage and Firestore Integration:
Real-Time Database: Firebase Firestore provides real-time database updates, ensuring messages and user data are instantly synced across all devices.

Cloud Storage: User data and media are stored securely using Firebase Cloud Storage, ensuring data integrity and accessibility.

PS: I have also uploaded a video walk-through of the app, suggestions for changes are highly appreciated! Hope you like it :)
